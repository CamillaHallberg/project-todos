# Project Todos

This project was about creating a to-do list application using React and Redux. 

## The problem

This was a fun project to work on since I love to-do lists! Most challenging part has definitely been to understand the different concepts of Redux, such as what a reducer does and what an action really is and just HOW everything connects. I find it to be a bit more clear after this week, even though I know I need more time for it to sink in and fully grasp the whole idea, and the Redux flow.

Another thing I tried out was to create a customized checkbox but I wasn't able to figure out how to align/position the default checkbox with my customized so after many hours I decided to leave that and go with a standard one. If I had more time to work on this I definitely would since it would be cool to have a well designed checkbox :)
